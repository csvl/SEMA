### Toolchain architecture
<a name="toolchain-architecture"></a>

Our toolchain is represented in the following figure and works as follows:

- A collection of labelled binaries from different malware families is collected and used as the input of the toolchain.
- **Angr**, a framework for symbolic execution, is used to execute binaries symbolically and extract execution traces. For this purpose, different heuristics have been developed to optimize symbolic execution.
- Several execution traces (i.e., API calls used and their arguments) corresponding to one binary are extracted with Angr and gathered together using several graph heuristics to construct a SCDG.
- These resulting SCDGs are then used as input to graph mining to extract common graphs between SCDGs of the same family and create a signature.
- Finally, when a new sample has to be classified, its SCDG is built and compared with SCDGs of known families using a simple similarity metric.

![Toolchain Illustration](./doc/images/SEMA_illustration.png)

This repository contains a first version of a SCDG extractor. During the symbolic analysis of a binary, all system calls and their arguments found are recorded. After some stop conditions for symbolic analysis, a graph is built as follows: Nodes are system calls recorded, edges show that some arguments are shared between calls.

When a new sample has to be evaluated, its SCDG is first built as described previously. Then, `gspan` is applied to extract the biggest common subgraph and a similarity score is evaluated to decide if the graph is considered as part of the family or not. The similarity score `S` between graph `G'` and `G''` is computed as follows:
Since `G''` is a subgraph of `G'`, this is calculating how much `G'` appears in `G''`.
Another classifier we use is the Support Vector Machine (`SVM`) with INRIA graph kernel or the Weisfeiler-Lehman extension graph kernel.

A web application is available and is called SemaWebApp. It allows to manage the launch of experiments on SemaSCDG and/or SemaClassifier.

### Pre-commit

This repository uses pre-commit to ensure that the code is formatted correctly and that the code is clean. To install pre-commit, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
